 <h3>must watch anime</h3>
 <p>Its impressive storyline and breathtaking visuals helped Demon Slayer secure its position as one of the new “Big Three” in anime. Demon Slayer follows Tanjiro Kamado on his quest to restore his sister's humanity after she becomes a demon due to being the sole survivor of her family's demon attack.</p>
 <br>
 <p>Demon slayer is a rather generic name. There is a good chance there are other anime called Demon slayer. Kimetsu no Yaiba actually means the blade that destroys demons.</p>
 <br>
 <p>Ashura is a demon or a god from Japanese mythology. It may be human-like in appearance, but its size, strength, and multiple arms distinguish it from other beings. Ashura has a lust for battle and loves to destroy things</p>
